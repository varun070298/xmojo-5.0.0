<center><font size=+2>Update Manager</font></center>

<p>The Update Manager is a tool which is used for installing the service
packs (.ppm file) over a product. The service pack may contain certain
bug fixes and new feature additions for a particular release version of
the product.

<blockquote>
<b>NOTE: The Update Manager is a contribution from AdventNet.
It is meant only for development usage within XMOJO project.
For more details, contact
<a href="mailto:support@adventnet.com">support@adventnet.com</a></b>
</blockquote>

<p>
The service pack can be classified to be either an ordinary
without referring to any context of the product (Non - Context based) or
it may be context based. This document explains about how to use the Update
manager for installation of Software upgrades in AdventNet products. It
can be also used by products developed over these products.
<p>Context based patch implies that the patch will have the consolidated
upgrades for all the different components of the same product.
The same patch can be used for updating any context of the product. The
Update manager also provides a feature for having Mandatory context and
Optional contexts. The Mandatory context can also be called compulsary
context and will not be displayed at the time of installation. An Optional
context is some additional upgrades, but is not absolutely necessary for
the product to function.
<p>The Update Manager also has some useful validation incorporated. This
validation includes compatability checks. If a service pack is not compatable
ie., service pack of one product is installed in other product , or service
pack of one product version installed in other version , then update manager
will not allow the user to install these types of service packs.
<p>To open the Update Manager tool run the "UpdateManager.bat/sh" file
present in the &lt;product home>/bin directory.&nbsp; The Update manager
UI lists the different versions of&nbsp; service pack installed for this
product. The details of each of the service packs can be viewed by selecting
the corresponding item in the list and clicking the details button.

<p>The Update manager can be operated in two modes ie., UI and non-UI mode.
For starting the update manager in command line or non-UI mode, there are
two ways.
<ol>
<li>
Run the UpdateManager.bat/sh file with <b>-c</b> as a command line argument.</li>

<li>
The user has to edit the script file ie., UpdateManager.bat or UpdateManager.sh
depending on the OS. The change required is very simple, just an addition
of one more argument -c (%JAVA_HOME%\bin\java -Xmx100m com.adventnet.tools.update.installer.UpdateManager&nbsp;
-u conf <b>-c</b>).</li>
